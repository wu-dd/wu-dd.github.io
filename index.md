## About Me

I completed my undergraduate studies at Zhejiang University, School of Earth Sciences, and am currently a third-year master's student at the same institution, under the supervision of [Prof. Feng Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/fengzhang).

## Research Interests

My research interests include the application of multimodal large language models and diffusion models in remote sensing.
